# ES6 - Top Gifs from Reddit API

This app connects to the reddit api and pulls in the top gifs with ES6. It has a nice full screen display.

I use live-server to run this app locally. 

To install live-server type:
<ul><li>npm install -g live-server</li></ul>

To run live-server type:
<ul><li>live-server</li></ul>

You can see the full file structure on the gh-pages branch. 

Have Fun! ES6 is the future!
